# cognosis
LLM OS, KB, JIT namespace for learning, perception, and motility -- under development. 


## notes
I've been developing this for some time under various names. This master branch of cognosis is the only maintained repo. Windows11 and Ubuntu 22.04 are the only supported platforms. Only NVIDIA (3/4)0XX and ryzen (5+)XXX support (on each platform). `master` platform is technially windows11+wsl2+ubuntu-22.04LTS & windows11 sandbox. `vanilla`(ubuntu) and `doors`(windows) branches will be single platform versions.
