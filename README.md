# cognosis
LLM OS, KB, JIT namespace for learning, perception, and motility -- under development. 


## notes
I've been developing this for some time under various names. This master branch of cognosis is the only maintained branch/repo. Only Windows11 and Ubuntu 22.04 are supported. Only NVIDIA 30XX and ryzen 5XXX are supported, but hardware support is very important to me and I am going to endeavor to support 'half' of my platform that being a 4GB+ 20XX and ryzen 30XX+ asap, I will establish that codebase in the jr branch. This is a work in progress and an earnest endeavor. I'm not a professional programmer, but I'm striving for good strategy patterns and architecture, in this repo. I'm still learning test-driven development and many of the industry/business standards & practices, not to mention 60 years of code convention, in general.
