# cognosis
LLM OS, KB, JIT namespace for learning, perception, and motility -- under development. 


## motility, black boxes, perception

OOP + MPI = IPC in a black box neuron/node framework. Objects are black boxes. Agents are objects the same as everything else. Agents are able to 'perceive' and preform and enact 'effects' (motility) via passing messages to other black boxes, only. This is all the setup needed begin scaffolding the framework of quantum informatics of entanglement with information/state/the 'rest of the network'.

'Entanglement' is a non-real quantity which is manifestable in a real (world) system; I posit via language (and the topology of 'information' which I posit must be relatable to angular momentum and energy)



## notes
I've been developing this for some time under various names. This master branch of cognosis is the only maintained repo. Windows11 and Ubuntu 22.04 are the only supported platforms. Only NVIDIA (3/4)0XX and ryzen (5+)XXX support (on each platform). `master` platform is technically windows11+wsl2+ubuntu-22.04LTS & windows11 sandbox. `vanilla`(ubuntu) and `doors`(windows) branches will be single platform versions.
